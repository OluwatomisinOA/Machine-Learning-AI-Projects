## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
 
## Why this repository?

I created this repository to strengthen my understanding of the math, logic, and intuition behind machine learning models, not just how to use them. Each project reflects what i've learned and experimented with along the way.

## Current Progress
- Foundations
   
## More to come
This repository will continue to grow as i explore more ML and AI concepts.
