What is Artificial Intelligence?
- AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
- Encompasses reeasoning, learning, perception and problem solving.
- Evolved over decades: from logic-based systems to deep learning.
- Goal: Build systems that can adapt, learn, and perform tasks autonomously.

Types of AI
- Narrow AI: Performs specific tasks. eaxmples of them are recommendation algorithms, speech recognition tools, facial recognition apps.(e.g, Siri, Google Translate).
- General AI: Human-level intelligence across tasks (still theoretical).
- Superintelligent AI: Surpasses human intelligence (futuristic concept).

Key Capabilities of AI Systems
- Machine Learning: Enable systems to learn from data.
- Natural Language Processing: Understanding and generating human language.
- Computer Vision: Interpreting visual inputs like images and video.
- Robotics: Acting upon the physical world based on AI reasoning.

Milestones in the History of AI
- 1956: AI coined at Dartmouth Conference
- 1997: IBM's Deep Blue defeats chess champion Garry Kasparov
- 2012: Breakthrough in deep learning with ImageNet
- 2016: AlphaGo defeats world Go champion Lee Sedol

The Scope and Impact of AI Today
- Ubiquitous in everyday life: phones, recommendations, assistants
- Driving innovation in industries: health, finance, law, education
- Powering smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and personalized medicine
