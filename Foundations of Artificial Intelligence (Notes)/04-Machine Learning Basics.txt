What is Machine Learning
- ML enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming
- Model identifies patterns, make predictions, and improve with experience
- Core to modern AI applications across industries
- ML != Hardcoded rules; it's adaptive and data-driven

Categories of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning: labeled data -> prediction (classification, regression)
- Unsupervised Learning: unlabeled data -> structure (clustering, PCA)
- Reinforcement Learning: agents learn via rewards and punishments
- Semi-supervised and self-supervised learning: hybrid approaches

The Machine Learning Workflow
- Collect and clean data
- Split data: training, validation, testing
- Choose and train a model
- Evaluate and optimize performance
- Deploy and monitor in the real world

Key Algorithms in Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression (relationships between features and a continuous output) and logistic regression (for binary classification)
- Decision trees (create flowchart like modeles and are easy to interpret and random forests(ensembles of decisiontrees that improve accuracy and robustness.
- Support vector machines (SVMs) find hyperplanes that best eparate classes
- k-nearest neighbours (KNN) classify by majority vote among the closest data points
- Neural networks stimulate brain like connections and are suited for complex patterns, especially in vision, speech and text

Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy: correct predictions / total
- Precision & Recall: performance on positives
- F1-Score: harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Confusion matrix: breakdown of true/false positives/negatives
- RMSE, MAE: for regression tasks

Bias, Variance, and Overfitting
- Underfitting: high bias, poor trainning performance
- Overfitting: high variance, poor generalization
- Goal: balance bias and variance for optimal performance
- Use regularization, cross-validation, and pruning

Feature Engineering and Selection
- Good features > complex models
- Normalize, scale, encode, and extract meaningful signals
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Avoid multicollinearity and irrelevant features

From ML to Deep Learning
- ML: interpretable, less data, lower compute
- DL: complex models, huge data, GPU-powered
- Transition when data grows or patterns are nonlinear
- Both coexist in modern AI stacks
