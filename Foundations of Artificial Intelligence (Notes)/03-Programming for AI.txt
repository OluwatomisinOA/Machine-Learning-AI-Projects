Why Programming Matters in AI
- Programming bridges math and real-world AI applications
- Python is the most widely used AI language
- Enables model creation, training, deployment, and automation
- Libraries simplifies complex mathematical operations

Python - The Language of AI
- Readable. flexible and dynamically typed
- Huge ecosystem: Numpy. Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Pytorch
- Ideal for experimenting and rapid prototyping
- Widely adopted in academia and industry

Numpy and Pandas - Data Wrangling Essentials
- Numpy: fast numerical computations, arrays, matrix operations
- Pandas: dataframes, CSV handling, data cleaning
- Both are foundational for ML preprocessing
- Efficient manipulaton of structured and unstructured data

Scikit-Learn - Traditional Machine Learning Made Easy
- Implements algorithms: regression, classification, clustering
- Easy to train, evaluate, and tune models
- Offers pipelines, preprocessing, and model selection tools
- Ideal for beginners and classical ML workflows

TensorFlow and Pytorch - Powering Deep Learning
- TensorFlow: scalable, production-ready, great for deployment
- Pytorch: intuitive, dynamic graphs, loved by researchers
- Both support neural nets, GPUs, and large-scale training
- Choose based on project needs: experimentation vs deployment

Streamlit and FastAPI - Building AI Apps
- Streamlif: create web apps with Python scripts
- FastAPI: build RESTful APIs for AI models
- Enable deployment of AI to users and systems
- Critical for turning models into uable tools

Programming Skills for AI
- Write modular, reusable an readable code
- Use Git for version control and collaboration
- Debug, profile, and tests models systematically
- Learn by building projects and solving real-world problems
