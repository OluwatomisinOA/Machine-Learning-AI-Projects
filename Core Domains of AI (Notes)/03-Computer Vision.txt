What is Computer Vision?
- Enables machines to interpret and process visual data
- Uses images, videos, and real-time camera feeds
- Core to self-driving cars, facial recognition, medical imaging
- Transforms pixels into predictions and insights

The Computer Vision Pipeline
- Image acquisition: camera feeds, file uploads, sensors
- PreprocessingP: resizing, normalization, augmentation
- Feature extraction: edges, shapes, textures
- Classification, detection, or segmentation

Traditional vs Deep Learning Approaches
- Traditional CV: manual features + classifiers (SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform), HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), SVM)
- Deep CV: CNNs automatically learn features
- Deep Learning vastly outperforms on complex tasks
- Less feature engineering, more scalability

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Use filters (kernels) to detect patterns in images
- Layers: convolution (applies filters to capture features) -> activation (e.g. ReLU, adds non-linearity) -> pooling (e.g max pooling, reduces spatial dimensions and computation) -> fully connected (fully connected layers use extracted features to make predictions)
- Hierarchical feature learning (edges -> textures -> objects)
- Backbone of modern CV systems

Key Computer Vision Tasks
- Image Classification: assign label to entire image
- Object Detention: locate and classify multiple objects
- Semantic Segmentation: classify each pixel
- Instance Segmentation: detect and differentiate individual objects

Advanced Vision Models
- ResNet: deep residual networks, overcome vanishing gradients
- YOLO: real-time object detention
- Mask R-CNN: combines detection and segmentation
- Vision Transformers (ViTs): use attention for visual tasks

Applications of Computer Vision
-Healthcare: cancer detection, radiology, surgery navigation
- Transportation: autonomous driving, traffic analysis
- Security: surveillance, facial recognition, anomaly detection
- Retail: casheirless checkout, shelf monitoring
- Agriculture: crop monitoring, pest detection

Challenges and Ethical Issues
- Bias in training data (racial gender, geographic)
- Privacy concerns (facial recognition, surveillance)
- Dataset labelling and copyright issues
- Adversarial attacks: small changes, big misclassifications
