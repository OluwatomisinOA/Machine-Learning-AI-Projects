What is NLP?
- NLP = AI + Linguistics: enabling machines to understand human language
- Converts unstructured text to structured meaning
- Powers chatbots, translators, summarizers, sentiment analyzers
- At the heart of LLMs like ChatGPT< Claude, Gemini

The NLP Pipeline
- Text preprocessing: tpkenization (split sentences into words or phrases), normalization (converts to lowercase, removes punctuation), stop word removal(eliminates common words)
- Feature extraction: TF-IDF, word embeddings
- Model training: supervised/unsupervised/deep learning
- Postprocessing: predictions, summaries, translations

Classical NLP Techniques
- Rule-based systems: grammar, syntax parsing
- Bag of Words (represents text by word frequency, good for classifications but loses word order) and TF-IDF for document classification (enchances by BOW by downgrading common words and emphasizing unique ones)
N-grams for context and word sequence patterns
- Named Entity Recognition (NER, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging

Word Embeddings - Capturing Meaning
- Converts words into dense vectors capturing meaning
- Word2Vec and Glove: learn relationships through context
- Semantic similiarity and analog solving
- Foundations of neural NLP models

Deep Learning for NLP
- RNNs handle sequential data, LSTMs solve long-term dependency issues
- CNNs extract local n-gram features from text
- Attention mechanism allow models to focus on key words
- Transformers replace recurrence with self-attention

Transformers and LLMs
- Transformer architecture underlines BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation fro Transformers), GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), T5, etc.
- Pretraining on massive text datasts, then fine-tuning
- Bidirectional (BERT) vs autogressive (GPT) models
- Foundation for chatbots, coding assistants, research summarizers

Real-World Applications of NLP
- Virtual assistants: Siri, Alexa, Google assitants
- Customer support: chatnots, email routing
- Translation and transcription (Google Translate, Whisper)
- Sentiment analysis, content moderation, legal and medical NLP

Challenges and Ethical Considerations
- Bias and toxicity in training data
- Hallucination: generating false but com=nfident responses
- Explainability and accpuntability
- Misinformation, manipulation, and deepfake text
